-Hi babby!
-First off, xoxoxo thanx 4 visiting me!
-I'm an indie game dev working primarily in my loving home, Unreal Engine.
-I'm on a quest to make games and save the coral reefs irl. Weird quest I know, but somehow the two are connected for me.
I'm in love with games and anything related to them. Let's talk!
